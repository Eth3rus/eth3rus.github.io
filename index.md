## Starship Update: December 13, 2024
SpaceX made major moves in South Texas yesterday as UTRGV's board approved selling their Stargate facility to the company for market value. Building on this momentum, SpaceX filed a petition today with Cameron County for a special election on incorporating Starbase as an official municipality, citing workforce growth needs for Starship production. The company also plans to relocate its headquarters to the new city.
Meanwhile, activities continue at the Massey's test site with Ship 33 undergoing both cryogenic loading and spin prime testing of its engines. Site construction also progresses, with a new vertical storage tank arriving overnight.

## Starship Update: December 11, 2024
An Intermittent road closure has been issued for highway 4 from 10am to 2pm for transportation from the Production Site to Massey's.
the Closure has since been revoked for unknown reasons.

## Starship Update: December 10, 2024
A white crane has lifted another piece of the flame trench for the second launch site inro position for assembly at the Sanchez lot. Later today Boosteer 14 was lifted off the Orbital launch Mount in preperation for transportation back to the Star Factory. Two large cryogenic propellent holding tanks were moved from the port of brownsville to the Launch Complex overnight, These tanks will expand the current capacity of the Orbital Tank Farm; to service the soon to be online Orbital Launch Integration Tower B. Later Booster 14 began it's roll back to the production site at Starbase for final inspections and FTS instillation for the upcoming seventh Integrated Test Flight of Starship. Flight seven will involve the first flight of a Block 2 (Version 2) upper stage (Ship 33). Flight seven will happen no earlier than January 11, 2025. After returning to the Production site, Booster 14 recieved the instillation of scaffolding frames around it's common dome area, the cause or implications of this are unknown.

## Starship Update: December 9, 2024
Scaffolding was removed from the Orbital Launch Mount in preparation for Booster 14's static fire, Booster 14 successfully conducted an igniter test. Highway 4 was closed for the delivery of propellant tanks to the launch complex,this tank will be used to expand the current orbital tank farm. 
highway 4 remained closed for testing on Booster 14, which may involve a full duration 33 engine static fire.
at 9:19 AM Superheavy Booster 14 successfully conducted a 33 Engine Full-Duration Static Fire test.

## Starship Update: December 7, 2024
Booster 14 began propellant loading and conducted a successful Spin Prime test. Booster 14 is now ready for Static Fire testing. The Massey's Starship Static Fire Stand is still poised outside of Megabay 2, rollout is expected soon. Cranes were recently lifted at Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin retrofitting of the KSC Mechazilla. Work on it postponed in 2022 as the current OLM Design was outdated, but now we have an updated design for Block 2 of Starship under construction at the Sanchez lot, along with the digging of a Flame Diverter/Trench at OLM 2 at Starbase. The 2 cranes at 39A Began dismantling the vertical LOX tank so that it can be replaced by horizontal bullet tanks similar to those at Starbase. Work on the 39A OLM should begin next year, and should come online at the end of 2025.
Ship 35's payload Bay section was spotted entering the highbay. This payload section had significantly less tiles on the sides, mimicking the design of Ship 31. This spotting of Ship 35's payload section indicates that a stacking will occur soon between the payload section and nosecone section. after these 2 sections are stacked the 2 stacked sections will be moved to Megabay 2 to allow for the rest of the sections to be stacked.

## Starship Update: December 6, 2024
SpaceX Transported Superheavy Booster 14 to the Launchsite via highway 4 for Static Fire tetsing. The Starship Static Fire stand was moved from Massey's to the Build sight in front of Megabay 2, for transport of Ship 33 to Massey's outpost for Static Fire Testing.
Closures are set for December 7 for Static fire testing of Booster 14 
and possible transportation of Ship 33 to the Massey's Outpost.
President-Elect Donald Trump has selected private astronaut and philanthropist Jared Isaacman to be the next administrator of NASA.
